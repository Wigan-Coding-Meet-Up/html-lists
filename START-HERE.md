# Welcome to HTML5 Lists.

In this section we will learn about the types of Lists in HTML and why we would use them and when?

There are usually 2 types of Lists in HTML.

an <b>Ordered List </b>typically looks like this:

<ol>
  <li>List item one</li>
  <li>List item two</li>
  <li>List item three</li>
</ol>

Notice how the list item's are numbered? Hence the name <b>Ordered List</b>
This is created in HTML with the  &#60;ol&#62;  tag.
