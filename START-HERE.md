### Ordered Lists

an <b>Ordered List </b>typically looks like this:

<ol>
  <li>List item one</li>
  <li>List item two</li>
  <li>List item three</li>
</ol>

Notice how the list item's are numbered? Hence the name <b>Ordered List</b>
This is created in HTML with the  &#60;ol&#62;  tag.

The &#60;li&#62; tag is the "List Item" tag. These tag's go together to make the <b>Ordered List </b>.
